## Introduction

#### What are you building?

We are building a visual essay writing application mainly aimed at neurodiverse and international students.

#### Why are you building it?

Oliver's students need a clear, user friendly interface to get the most out his educational method.

#### Project scope

The key features of our MVP will include:

- Being able to write, edit and save the different sections of an essay following Oliver's method.
- Being able to export an essay as PDF or MS DOC.
- Providing the students with the resources they need to succeed.
- Students are able to choose a theme or personalised colours to support them in their planning and reading.

#### What are you not building?

We are not building a video hosting platform.
The product owner will provide the resources.

#### How did you decide what features were important?

User research and consulting and designing alongside the product owner.

### Project plan

#### How are you going to structure your sprints?

- Design sprint
- Build sprint 1
- Build srpint 2

#### How did user research inform your plan?

We had 7 users of varying ages, education experience and background.

Their feedback was:

- Clear instructions around use and navigation.
- Having resources side by side while writing the essay.
- Having sections broken down.
- Having an option to personalise colours.
- making sure the essay question is always visible.

## Requirement analysis

#### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

- Semantic HTML.
- Aria compliant CSS.
- Reponsive design.

#### Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

## Project learnings

#### Did your team work effectively?

#### What would you do differently next time?

## Research and findings

#### What did you find out from user testing?

## Project outcomes

#### Were your assumptions right or wrong?

##Â Recommendations and conclusions

#### What features would you prioritise to build next?

#### Was the project a success?

## Software Development Lifecycle stages

### Planning

#### What roles did your team take on?

##### Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)

Scrum Facilitator & Liason - Oli
DevOps - Adam
QA & Documenter - Paolo
UX / UI - Split Responsibility

#### Did these roles help your team work effectively?

##### Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)

## Analysis

#### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

## Design

#### How did you plan a user experience?

#### What technical decisions did you make?

- Server-render vs client-render vs both
- Relational or non-relational or no DB
- Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
- Frontend first vs DB first

#### Did you create a technical specification?

##### Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)

## Implementation/Build

#### How did you ensure your code was good?

##### Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

#### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

##### Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

#### How did you debug issues that arose?

##### Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

## Test

#### How did you verify your project worked correctly?

##### Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

#### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?

##### Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)

## Deploy

#### Where/how did you deploy your application?

##### Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)

#### What problems did you encounter during deployment?

## Maintain

#### Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?

#### Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
